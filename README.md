This is an attempt at an accessible annotation scheme.

[Demo](https://RichCaloggero.github.io/annotator.git/annotator.html)

## Instructions

1. click the "edit" button to enable editing
2. Put focus on the text via tab, find the start of text to be annotated and press the "*" (asterisk) key. A message will appear showing that you have successfully marked the start of the annotation.
3. Move to the end of the text to be annotated and again press "*".  Now you have an entry in the annotations list at the bottom of the page.  
	- Clicking an item in the list will select that text and focus the text area.  The screen reader will read the selected text when the element gains focus, the browser highlights the selection, and the caret is moved to the end of the selection.
